# Face-Nebula
I've always felt that people nowadays, whether it's uploaded to social media or those photos they keep for themselves, always have all sorts of demands on them. Different individuals want their appearance enhanced and others work toward flawless composition and still others seek attractive backgrounds. I place the greatest value in group pictures on the honest emotions that pass quickly rather than external elements. A photograph serves as a communication tool to express emotions but preserving our psychological state during social interactions delivers the real worth. I aim to capture unobserved genuine emotional moments in order to establish everlasting memories from them.

The abstract design will serve as my method to depict our intricate and fragile emotional changes. Each emotion of individual characters in my works becomes a distinct pattern or visual representation. Each person moulds their emotional symbolism by showing themselves along with supporting their internal transformations. Each symbol starts by existing individually until several symbols converge simultaneously leading to the slow formation of hidden connexions similar to emotional self-generated bonds that evolve into linked emotional universes shared between them.

I hope that no matter if the participants are strangers, a family, a group of friends, a couple, or even two people who have had conflicts, they can leave a special “emotional photo” through this interaction. This photo practise goes beyond facial documentation since it captures emotions while blocking subject faces into a single frame that captures genuine heart connexions.
